Welcome to the music chord app!
This app will allow you to input chord names and it will display the notes 
that make up the chord, and the tabs for that chord on an instrument. 
Then you can input a number of half steps you'd like the chords to be transposed, 
or you can input new chords.
Type 'f' or 's' anytime to change between flats or sharps representation.
Type 'u', 'g', 'b', or 'n' to change between instruments anytime.
'u' is ukulele, 'g' is guitar, 'b' is banjo, and 'n' is no instrument.
Chords that are supported are:
major, minor, sus, sus2, aug, dim, and maj7, dom7, or maj6 can be added to add an extra interval.
